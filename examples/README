What is it?
===========

Here are some examples on how to use the Jellyfish library and
potentially useful programs to compute data from Jellyfish
output. Each directory is an independent project which relies on
Jellyfish between installed and is available with pkg-config. Meaning
'pkg-config --print-provides jellyfish-2.0' returns something like
'jellyfish-2.0 = 2.1.1'.

Disclaimer
==========

Notice that the code in these directory is not as well tested as the
rest of the Jellyfish code. It should work but no guaranteed is made.
