What is it?
===========

Given a jellyfish database and one or more input fast[aq] files, it
output for each sequence in the fast[aq] files the count in the
database of each of the k-mers. The output format is fasta, where the
header is copied from the input files and the content is a number for
each of the k-mers. If the sequence has length n, there will be n-k+1
numbers, corresponding in order to the n-k+1 k-mers in the sequence.

For example:

$ ./query_per_sequence db.jf sequence.fa
>read1
0 0 0 1 1 2 3 3 3 4 2
>read2
15 16 17 13 12 11 12 12 10 7 6
...
